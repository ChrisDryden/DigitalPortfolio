Building models to simulate protein binding for drug discovery in the area of epigenetics.

"The Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) is a not-for-profit public-private-partnership focused on pre-competitive drug discovery that supports the discovery of new medicines through open access research. Our chemical biology program has delivered over 60 high-quality chemical probes that are distributed to 5000 laboratories every year. These open-science reagents have been used in over 3000 journal articles since 2011, and contributed to the launch of 30 clinical trials by 8 companies."
